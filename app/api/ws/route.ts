  // For Next.js, we'll simulate it.
  // This part is tricky because Next.js API routes are designed for HTTP, not persistent connections.
  // A more robust solution for Next.js would involve a custom server or a third-party service.

  // For now, we'll just return a response indicating the WebSocket is ready.
  // The actual WebSocket connection will be initiated from the client side.
